# About

Newly-minted TechsGiving AI and Automation Fellow based in Saint Catherine, Jamaica, with a reignited passion for coding! I'm currently exploring the world of JavaScript and Python. In my free time, I enjoy 
* apiculture (looking to build an apiary monitoring app someday!)
* container gardening (toying with the idea of growing calendars specifically for the Caribbean)
* foreign language films, 
* reading

I'm excited to learn, contribute to open-source projects, and explore collaboration opportunities, especially in cybersecurity and data protection!
